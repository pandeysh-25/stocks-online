          <br>
          <h6 class= "white-text">The world has rightfully become disillusioned with the stock market. The financial crisis of 2008, a direct product of Wall Street's self-indulgence
            , was the moment we realized that change in the industry is necessary. Stock-brokers were strongly biased by their prior knowledge.</h6>
            <h6 class="white-text">Lowest performance was found for inferences in which the problems caused a conflict between logical validity and the experts' belief. In these cases, the stock-brokers tended to make logically
             invalid inferences rather than give up their existing beliefs. This led to the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression of 1929.
              However, very little suggests that these same stock-brokers have learnt their lessons.
          </h6>
          <h6 class="white-text">When you think of stock trading, you think of the wall street, the different stock exchanges of the world and of course "The Wolf of Wall Street". You
               would think stock trading is too complicated and lets not forget the hassle with stockbrokers. But with StocksOnline you can enter the world of bulls 
               and bears all by yourself i.e., without any brokers. Our interactive UI makes it easy for anyone to know what the stock market is about, especially 
               for stock market newbies.  </h6>
