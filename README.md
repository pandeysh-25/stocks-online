# StocksOnline

A Python + Django stocks trading platform


  
The project is an online stock trading firm, i,e a brokerage firm. 
This firm helps in the  sale and purchase of shares of publicly listed companies in the stock market on a daily basis. This system was developed to provide ease of access of data of various stock owners,including salient information about the price, volatility and change of each share.
This firm assists first-time  clients who use the firm as a gateway into stock trading and into the wider market, offering them ways to buy and sell  stocks at a fair industry-standard 30% transaction fee.

The firm database stores information about every transaction done by any certain consumer, containing details of the transaction, the stocks involved, bought or sold, date of transaction and other details. We use this to provide users with a look at their portfolio every time they log in. The firm also offers facilities for a customer  to add money into their account. 
The intention behind StocksOnline is to provide people with little to no knowledge about the stock market to be able to invest money and get returns.

Python, Django and MySQL were used in this project.
